Would it really be a complete React tutorial without a simple todo app guide through?
I created this simple todo app using react hooks. It's a simple app that takes a task,delete and highlight the task.
I initialized my project using the React npm create-react-app.
I first created a components folder in the src public folder. The components folder contained the todo,todoapp and todolist components.
The 'Todo component' contains the logic for the individual todo.

 A simple todo conatins text and three buttons for deleting,highlighting and marking if an item is complete or not. The complete button takes the "completedTasks" function.

The delete button deletes a task if the selsected item matches the todo's id. I used the Math.random() function to generate the ids. It isn't a reliable a way to generate ids for huge projects, use a designated library instead.

Don't forget to define the following states at the top of your 'Todo' component.

Next up is the "TodoList" component. this component will the parent component for our 'Todo' component. It takes the todos and renders each individual 'Todo' into a list.

After the 'TodoList component' we have the 'TodoApp component'. It conatins the form which takes in the user's input. It also returns the 'TodoList compoment'.

I used the following to update the input text and the todos using the 'handleChange' function and the 'addTodo' functions respectively.

The input takes the 'handleChange' function.

I also updated the todos using the 'addTodo function', which takes the original todos presents and those that we input through keying in.

Lastly but certainly not least, in the 'app.js' we render the'TodoApp component'.

At last we add the styling to make our app a bit more appealing to the eye.
